  abstract = {Vertical C-2 body fractures are presented in 15 patients with clinical and imaging correlations that suggest the existence of a variety of mechanisms of injury. In these patients, clinical and imaging correlations were derived by: 1) defining the point of impact by clinical examination; 2) defining the point of impact by soft-tissue changes on cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computerized tomography (CT); 3) obtaining an accurate history of the mechanism of injury; and 4) spine imaging (x-ray studies, CT, and MR imaging) of the C-2 body fracture and surrounding bone and soft tissue. The cases presented involve the region located between the dens and the pars interarticularis of the axis. Although these fractures are rarely reported, they are not uncommon. An elucidation of their pathological anatomy helps to further the understanding of the mechanistic etiology of upper cervical spine trauma. A spectrum of mechanisms of injury causing upper cervical spine fractures was observed. The type of injury incurred is determined predominantly by the force vector applied during impact and the intrinsic strength and anatomy of C-2 and its surrounding spinal elements. From this clinical experience, two types of vertical C-2 body fractures are defined and presented: coronally oriented (Type 1) and sagittally oriented (Type 2). A third type of C-2 body fracture, the horizontal rostral C-2 fracture (Type 3), is added for completeness; this Type 3 fracture is the previously described Type III odontoid process fracture described by Anderson and D'Alonzo.},

  abstract = {Background context The classification scheme of odontoid fractures described by Anderson and D'Alonzo is the one most commonly used. However, uncertainty exists in the distinction between Type \{II\} and �shallow� Type \{III\} fractures. Moreover, fractures at the base of the odontoid (Anderson and D'Alonzo Type II) include a spectrum of injury patterns. Purpose To modify the Anderson and D'Alonzo classification of odontoid fractures based on current clinical treatment options. Study design Proposal of a modified classification system for odontoid fractures. Methods A more precise distinction between Type \{II\} and \{III\} fractures based on the presence/absence of C1�C2 facet involvement is proposed. A modified classification of Type \{II\} fractures based on fracture line obliquity, displacement and comminution is then proposed, because these are factors deemed to influence management. To evaluate the reproducibility of this classification, 52 odontoid fractures were reviewed and classified by four attending spine surgeons and three spine fellows. Results There was substantial agreement (at least five of seven respondents) in 70\% of cases. The overall kappa value for the modified classification system was 0.48, indicating moderate agreement, and there were no differences in kappa values between attending spine surgeons and fellows. Conclusions The reproducibility of this system was demonstrated by the moderate agreement observed when applied to odontoid fractures at our institution. The proposed utility of this system is its ability to guide clinical decision making in the treatment of odontoid fractures. Prospective application of this modified classification system and suggested treatment options is now required. },

  abstract = {An index for measuring the vertical relationship of atlas and axis is described.\\ Deduction and application of vertical atlantoaxial index (VAAI) for quantifying the vertical atlantoaxial relationship of atlas and axis and classifying basilar invagination (BI) based on the VAAI.\\ A number of craniospinal parameters have been described to quantify the amount of BI in relation to herniation of odontoid into the cranium. Successful treatment of BI by distraction of atlantoaxial facet joint, placement of a spacer to maintain the distraction, and lateral mass fixation has been described recently. The treatment is based on the understanding that BI is in fact a disease of the atlantoaxial facet joints and is a result of progressive vertical instability. With this new concept and technique that involves preserving all bony elements and reduction of BI in the form of reducing the vertical atlantoaxial subluxation, we thought it was prudent to formulate an index to quantify the relation of atlas and axis in the sagittal plane.\\ Mid-sagittal computerized tomography (CT) scan films of 90 cases of BI treated by us between October 1999 and May 2005 with distraction and lateral mass plate and screw fixation were analyzed before and after surgery. The age of the patients ranged from 8 to 55 years and the male:female ratio was 2.5:1. Additionally, mid-sagittal CT scan films of hundred normal subjects in the same age group were analyzed as a control group. The VAAI was measured in all cases. VAAI is an index that measures the vertical relationship of the atlas and axis. The images were compiled and copies of the compilation were made. Two observers independently performed the measurements and intraobserver as well as interobserver agreement was assessed using the intraclass corelation (ICC) ) test (SigmaStat).\\ The preoperative mean and mode values of VAAI in this series of patients were 0.53 (0.20 to 0.67) and 0.61, respectively. The postoperative mean and mode values of VAAI are 0.78 (range, 0.60 to 0.89) and 0.80, respectively. The mean and mode values of VAAI in general population were 0.80 (range, 0.76 to 0.85) and 0.80, respectively. The results in preoperative patients with BI demonstrated excellent intraobserver (ICC=0.96 and 0.98) and interobserver corelation coefficient (ICC=0.96). The results in normal subjects and postoperative CT scans of operated patients with BI also showed excellent intraobserver (ICC=0.97 and 0.98) and interobserver corelation coefficient (ICC=0.97).\\ VAAI can be an excellent measurement tool for the assessment of relationship of atlas and axis. Nonrheumatoid BI can be graded and classified depending on the value of VAAI.},

  abstract = {This study was undertaken because there is a dearth of objective information in the literature on the clinical instability of the cervical spine below C2. To our knowledge, it is the first biomechanical investigation designed to analyze clinical stability. We have carried out a quantitative analysis of the behavior of the spine as a function of the systematic destruction of various anatomic elements. Under controlled conditions designed to maintain the biological integrity of the specimens, 17 motion segments from 8 cervical spines were analyzed. The spines were studied with either flexion or extension simulated using physiologic loads. Some of the more important findings are: (1) In sectioning the ligaments, one observes small increments of change followed without warning by sudden, complete disruption of the spine; (2) Removal of the facets alters the motion segment such that in flexion, there is less angular displacement and more horizontal displacement; (3) The anterior ligaments contribute more to stability in extension than the posterior ligaments and in flexion, the converse is true; (4) The adult cervical spine is unstable, or on the brink of instability, when any of the following conditions are present: a) All the anterior or all the posterior elements are destroyed or unable to function. b) More than 3.5 mm horizontal displacement of one vertebra in relation to an adjacent vertebra measured on lateral roentgenograms (resting or flexion-extension). c) More than 11 degrees of rotation difference to that of either adjacent vertebra measured on a resting lateral or flexion-extension roentgenogram. These findings can be aptly applied to clinical situations and when instability as determined by the above criteria is present, surgical fusion or some other method to achieve stability should be seriously considered. Work is continuing on this problem as we do not consider this to be altogether complete or definitive. Hopefully, this initial study will stimulate further scientific and clinical investigations.},

  abstract = {Atlanto-axial rotatory fixation (AARF) is a rare condition which occurs more commonly in children than in adults. The terminology can be confusing and the condition is also known as 'atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation' and 'atlanto-axial rotary dislocation'. Rotatory fixation is the preferred term, however, as in most cases the fixation occurs within the normal range of rotation of the joint. By definition, therefore, the joint is neither subluxed nor dislocated. AARF is a cause of acquired torticollis. Diagnosis can be difficult and is often delayed. The radiologist plays a key role in confirming the diagnosis. The classification system proposed by Fielding in 1977 is most frequently used and will be discussed in detail. Given that this classification system was devised in the days before computed tomography (CT), as well as the fact that combined atlanto-axial and atlanto-occipital rotatory subluxation (AORF) is omitted from the classification, we propose a modification to the classification of this rare but significant disorder. The radiological findings in six cases of AARF will be illustrated, including a case with associated atlanto-occipital subluxation. The pertinent literature is reviewed and a more comprehensive classification system proposed. The imaging approach to diagnosis and the orthopaedic approach to management will be discussed.},

Early diagnosis depends on awareness of the possibility of AARF, and either fluoroscoping the patient in order to take appropriate spot films or imaging the atlanto-axial joint by CT. A simple classification of AARF is proposed based on distinct radiological features which differentiate subluxation from dislocation.},

Twenty-six percent of patients with upper cervical spine injuries (31 cases) were found to have combined injuries involving either the upper or the upper and lower cervical spine. The frequent patterns were combined type I bipedicular fracture of the axis and dens fracture, and combined dens fracture and fracture of the posterior arch of C 1. Other patterns posed specific problems, such as combined dens and Jefferson fracture and combined dens and C2 articular pillar fracture. Seventy percent of atlas fractures, 30% of C2 traumatic spondylolistheses and 30% of dens fractures were part of a combination. A total of 1.7% of patients with lower cervical spine injuries had a combined injury in the upper cervical spine. A comprehensive therapeutic schedule is outlined. Combined injuries in the upper cervical spine should be sought in any patient with a cervical spine injury.},

  abstract = {Retrospective medical record review.\\ The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence of other injuries that commonly occur in conjunction with cervical spine fractures and dislocations.\\ Cervical spine fractures are often associated with other significant traumatic conditions, which may also require prompt diagnosis and management. However, the relative incidences of the injuries that occur in conjunction with various cervical spine fractures have not been well documented.\\ The radiographic reports of all patients who underwent CT scans of the cervical spine at a single level 1 trauma center over a 10-year period were reviewed. The medical records of individuals with acute, nonpenetrating fractures of the cervical spine were further assessed for any associated traumatic pathology including noncontiguous spine injuries and those affecting other organ systems (i.e., head and neck, intrathoracic, intra-abdominal/pelvic, and nonspinal orthopedic disorders).\\ A total of 13,896 CT scans of the cervical spine were performed during this 10-year period of which 492 revealed acute fractures and/or dislocations. Of these subjects, 60% had sustained at least one additional injury. Overall, 57% were noted to have extraspinal injuries (34% head and neck, 17% intrathoracic, 10% intra-abdominal/pelvic, and 30% nonspinal orthopedic conditions) and noncontiguous spinal trauma was present in 19% of these cases (8% cervical injuries, 8% thoracic, and 6% lumbar). In general, the rates of associated injuries observed with occipital condyle and C7 fractures were significantly higher than those recorded for other cervical segments.\\ For patients with a known history of cervical spine trauma, the frequencies of associated injuries were similar across all levels of the cervical spine with the exception of the injuries to the craniocervical junctions. In practice, this means that injuries to the cervical spine can likely be grouped together when considering other possible associated injuries. Further elucidation of these injury patterns will likely be useful for facilitating the expedient evaluation and proper management of these individuals.},

There is currently little reliable information regarding natural cervical spine injury patterns after blunt trauma. This substudy of the National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study project was designed to accurately assess the prevalence, spectrum, and distribution of cervical spine injury after blunt trauma.\\ We prospectively enrolled all patients with blunt trauma undergoing cervical spine radiography at 21 diverse institutions. Injury status was determined by review of all radiographic studies obtained on each patient. For each individual injury, we recorded which specific films revealed the injury, the level and location of injury on each vertebra, and the age and sex of the patient.\\ Of 34,069 enrolled patients with blunt trauma, 818 (2.4%) individuals had a total of 1,496 distinct cervical spine injuries to 1,285 different cervical spine structures. The second cervical vertebra was the most common level of injury (286 [24.0%] fractures, including 92 odontoid fractures), and 470 (39.3%) fractures occurred in the 2 lowest cervical vertebrae (C6 and C7). The vertebral body, injured in 235 patients, was the most frequent site of fracture. Nearly one third of all injuries (29.3%) were considered clinically insignificant.\\ Cervical spine injuries occur in a small minority of patients with blunt trauma who undergo imaging. The atlantoaxial region is the most common site of injury, and the sixth and seventh vertebrae are involved in over one third of all injuries. Other spine levels are much more commonly involved than has previously been appreciated. A substantial minority of radiographically defined cervical spine injuries are of little clinical importance.},

  abstract = {Odontoid fractures are the most common geriatric cervical spine fractures. Nonunion rates have been reported to be up to 40\% and mortality up to 35\%, and poor functional outcomes are common. Atlantoaxial instability (AAI) is a plausible prognostic factor, but its role has not been previously examined.\\ To determine the effect of severe AAI on the outcomes of nonunion and mortality in patients with acute odontoid fractures.\\ Retrospective cohort/single institution.\\ One hundred twenty-four consecutive patients with acute odontoid fractures.\\ Rates of nonunion and mortality.\\ Two independent blinded reviewers measured AAI using postinjury computed tomography scans. Patients were classified as having "severe" or "minimal" AAI on the basis of greater versus less than or equal to \% mean subluxation across each C1-C2 facet joint. Rates of nonunion and mortality were compared using independent samples t tests and adjusted for age, displacement, and subtype using binary logistic regression.\\ One hundred seven patients had minimal AAI and 17 had severe AAI. Mean follow-up was 4.4 months (standard deviation=4.6). Patients with severe AAI were more likely to experience nonunion (29% vs. 10%, respectively; p=.03) and mortality (35% vs. 14%, respectively; p=.03) regardless of treatment modality. Fracture displacement correlated with AAI (r(2)=0.65). When adjusted for patient age, the odds ratio of nonunion with severe AAI approached significance at 3.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-11.7). Mortality prediction with AAI approached a twofold increased risk (odds ratio=2.1; 95% CI: 0.6-6.8). In patients with Type-II fractures, the odds of mortality with severe AAI approached a threefold higher risk (odds ratio=3.3; 95% CI: 0.9-12.3).\\ Patients with acute odontoid fractures and severe AAI may be more likely to experience nonunion and mortality, suggesting the possibility that aggressive management could be warranted. Further investigation with a large prospective study including patient-important functional outcomes is justified.},

Each patient was analysed by reviewing the medical records, the initial radiographs and CT-scans.\\ Level 1 trauma centre from 01/1996 to 12/2000.\\ The most common cause of accident was a high-energy fall (39%), followed by traffic accidents (26.5%). While fall related fractures were evenly distributed over the whole spine, traffic accidents induced significantly more fractures of the cervical and thoracic spine. Sixty-five percent of all cervical spine fractures and 80% of the multisegmental injuries were accompanied by an associated injury. The highest incidence of associated injuries was observed in patients with multilevel fractures (96.5%). Patients with a concomitant injury were more likely to sustain a spinal cord lesion. Sixty-three (11.2%) patients exhibited a complete motor and sensory deficit, 76 (13.5%) an incomplete and 423 (75.3%) no neurological deficit. The highest number of complete motor and sensory neurological deficits was found in cervical spine fractures (19.7%). The majority of patients, 308 (54.8%), sustained a compression fracture, 95 (16.9%) a distraction fracture, and 104 (18.5%) patients experienced a rotational fracture.\\ This study demonstrates correlations between the cause of accident, the type of spinal fracture and the fracture distribution.

  abstract = {In the treatment of spine fractures and fracture-dislocations, stability of the spine is one of the major objectives. In the craniocervical joint, the alar and transverse ligaments provide much of the stability of the healthy spine. Because the anatomy appears well described, the contribution of each of these structures so far has received little attention. The alar ligament restrains rotation of the upper cervical spine, whereas the transverse ligament restricts flexion as well as anterior displacement of the atlas. A lesion in one or both structures can produce damage to the neural structures and/or cause pain. To investigate the possible role of each of these ligaments, a mechanical and histologic study of the upper cervical spine was made. The bone-ligament-bone complex of the alar and transverse ligaments was subjected to uniaxial mechanical testing in seven specimens. The alar ligaments had an in vitro strength of 200 N, and the transverse ligaments had an in vitro strength of 350 N. Histologic analysis revealed a mainly collagenous nature of these ligaments. Clinical evidence (broken odontoid processes) suggests that the transverse ligament is strong enough to withstand physiologic loads. The alar ligament, on the other hand, due to its lower strength and its axial direction of loading, might be prone to injury and therefore require stabilization of the appropriate ve% 26984912

  abstract        = {Craniocervical distraction injury is a class of injuries that involve the skull base, the atlas, and the axis. Although these injuries often are overt imaging and clinical findings, the injury can be masked during unreliable physical examinations and difficult to identify during diagnostic imaging. The goal of this study was to identify on coronal and sagittal CT multiplanar reformations precise measurements and qualitative relations between anatomic landmarks that can help in establishing the diagnosis of craniocervical distraction injury. We performed a retrospective review of the cases of 35 patients with craniocervical distraction injury admitted to our trauma center from 2000 to 2006. Two independent radiologists made several qualitative and quantitative anatomic assessments on reformatted CT images through the craniocervical junctions (skull base through C2) of the 35 patients and of 50 other patients sustaining blunt trauma who were discharged without findings of cervical spinal injury. Logistic regression, recursive partitioning, and multivariate analysis were performed in an attempt to find measurements that differentiated the groups. Among the patients with craniocervical distraction injury, statistically significant positive correlations were found in several measurements, including midline occiput-C1 spinolaminar distance (p=0.0016), midline C1-C2 spinolaminar distance (p<0.0001), basion-dens distance (p<0.0001), sum of condylar displacement (p=0.0002), and basion-posterior axial line distance (p<0.0001). Several quantitative parameters on sagittal and coronal multiplanar CT reformations can be used to differentiate patients with craniocervical distraction injury from patients without this injury.},

  abstract        = {Lateral cervical spine films from 175 normal examinations of adults performed in the emergency room of North Carolina Baptist Hospital were analyzed to establish some norms and relationships in the upper cervical spine. The predens angle was found to be between 0 degree-13 degrees (mean 5.57 degrees) in neutral position and 0-18 degrees (mean 9.27 degrees) in flexion in most persons. Ninety-two percent of persons have angles greater than 3 degrees in flexion. A V-shaped predens space is not indicative of injury to the cruciate ligament. Virtually every person has posterior slanting or tilting of the dens and the range of values is up to 35 degrees (mean 17.43 degrees). Ninety-eight percent of persons have an angle greater than 6 degrees. A tilted dens does not indicate acute or remote trauma. No relationship was identified between the predens angle and the dens tilt angle. The posterior arch of the atlas can be found at any position between the occiput and spinous process of C2 in all positions of the head and neck. Hence, fanning or widening of the C1-C2 interspinous distance is not a reliable index of ligamentous injury in the upper cervical spine.},

The age of the patients ranged from 23 to 58 years. The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 1 to 10 years. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the osteosynthesis after screw fixation and postoperative bracing. In the 32 cases, 19 patients underwent single screw and 13 underwent double screw fixation. Postoperatively, light head halter traction was applied with the patients in bed for 1 to 4 weeks followed by a halo-vest for 8 to 14 weeks. Fractures healed in 9 weeks on average. There were no cases of delayed union. The overall results were excellent in 26 cases (81.3%), good in 5 (15.6%), and fair in 1 (3.1%) patient (who had a type Il fracture). There were no difference in dens union patterns between those receiving one-screw and two-screw fixation, and there were no complications during or after the operative procedure. Postoperatively there were no restriction of motion in the neck and no residual neck pain. Direct osteosynthesis of the fractured dens with screws is an effective procedure for unstable type II and III fracture of the dens. Postoperative external immobilization with a cervical brace seems to be an important contributing factor to the equal fusion rates in both groups of patients.},

Type II fracture, the most common type of odontoid fracture, is considered relatively unstable. It occurs at the base of the odontoid between the level of the transverse ligament and the C2 vertebral body. In the geriatric population, it is important to look for any associated clinical comorbidities that might affect management. Treatment options for displaced odontoid fractures can be conservative or surgical. Conservative management includes immobilization in a cervical collar or in a halo vest. External immobilization with a cervical collar has had inconsistent results. Halo vest immobilization in the elderly is associated with a significant nonunion rate and several complications. Generally accepted surgical indications are polytrauma, neurologic deficit, associated unstable subaxial spine injury that requires surgical fixation, and symptomatic nonunion. Surgical management includes either anterior odontoid screw fixation or posterior C1-C2 instrumentation with fusion.},

To report on a neurologically intact adult with bilateral traumatic atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation/dislocation and associated facet fracture, and present a review of the literature. Unilateral rotatory dislocation is relatively common at the atlantoaxial articulation. On the contrary, atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation with bilateral facet dislocation is uncommon, particularly in adults. Periodic reports have appeared in the literature regarding this entity in children, but only two previous citations have involved adults. The patient was followed-up through personal examination and chart review from initial presentation to 5 months after discharge. Closed reduction with cervical traction was followed by surgical fusion with stable repair and no neurologic deficits over 5 months follow-up. Traumatic bilateral atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation is uncommon in adults. This probably is due to the unique biomechanical features of the atlantoaxial articulation and the probable lethality of injury to the adjacent medulla or vertebral arteries before presentation at the trauma center.},

  abstract        = {This is a cadaver study in which video fluoroscopy is used to measure motion of the unstable spine at C1-C2 during intubation maneuvers. To quantify the amount of motion that occurs at an unstable C1-C2 spinal segment during the use of various intubation techniques using a cadaver model. In previous work by the authors, a methodology and measurements for the unstable C5-C6 segment in a cadaver model were developed. These studies showed that the most motion was created by a chin lift and jaw thrust and that oral techniques created more motion than nasal intubation. The potential motion that occurs during intubation with instability at C1-C2 is yet unstudied. Therefore, a study to determine the effects of intubation on the spine with an unstable C1-C2 segment was designed. Six human cadavers were used for the study. Measurements before and after transoral osteotomy of the odontoid were performed using video fluoroscopy. Pre-intubation maneuvers and oral and nasal intubation were studied. Oral intubation and nasal intubation caused similar diminution of space available for the cord. Chin lift and jaw thrust caused a larger diminution of space available for the cord than either nasal or oral intubation techniques. Although nasal intubation is the accepted procedure for intubation of the unstable spine, nasal and oral intubation seemed to have the same ability to narrow the space available for the cord in the model in this study. Great care should be taken while performing the chin lift/jaw thrust maneuvers in preparation for intubation, because these pre-intubation techniques caused the most motion and hence narrowed the space available for the cord in the unstable cervical spine.},

Treatment includes conservative management (external immobilisation devices) or surgical treatment (internal fixation by posterior fusion or anterior screw fixation). To compare surgical with conservative treatment for fractures of the odontoid process. We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (February 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2008), EMBASE (1988 to February 2008), LILACS (accessed February 2008), reference lists of articles and registries of ongoing trials. Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing surgical versus conservative management of odontoid fractures. Two review authors independently examined the search results to identify trials for inclusion. We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. We excluded one ongoing and registered study that is comparing surgery versus conservative treatment because it does not involve randomisation of treatment allocation. There is no evidence available from adequately controlled trials to inform the decision on whether the surgical treatment of odontoid fractures gives a better outcome. A sufficiently powered good quality multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing surgery versus conservative treatment is warranted.},

The diagnosis was suggested by the plain roentgenograms and tomograms and confirmed by persistence of the deformity as demonstrated by cineroentgenography. Treatment included skull traction, followed by atlanto-axial arthrodesis if necessary. Of the thirteen patients treated by atlanto-axial arthrodesis, eleven had good results, one had a fair result, and one had not been followed for long enough to determine the result. Of the remaining four patients, one treated conservatively had not been followed for long enough to evaluate the result, two declined surgery, and one died while in traction as the result of cord transection produced by further rotation of the atlas on the axis despite the traction.},

Of the six treated by the authors, one death (by pontine hemorrhage) occurred in a patient with a displaced avulsion fracture on the right occipital condyle (Type III). All others attained solid union with appropriate immobilization. Morphologically, one presented with an impacted fracture of the occipital condyle (Type I), one with a basilar skull fracture that included an occipital condyle fracture (Type II), and four had avulsion fractures of the occipital condyle. The latter are potentially unstable since loss of integrity of alar ligaments may coexist. Type I and II are stable, and the authors recommend treatment with a semiconstrained cervical orthosis. Type III injuries, which are potentially unstable, require rigid immobilization.},

  abstract        = {A retrospective review of a clinical series. To evaluate the use of a rigid cervical collar alone as the treatment for stable Jefferson fracture, and to devise an algorithm for treatment of Jefferson fracture with or without an associated cervical injury. The traditional treatment for Jefferson fracture, if there is no indication for surgery, is immobilization by halo vest. Because halo vest placement is associated with intracranial infection and a significant degree of patient discomfort, slightly less rigid forms of external immobilization may be useful for the treatment of stable Jefferson fractures. No standard protocol calling for the use of one form of stabilization device has been reported. The medical records and radiographs of 16 consecutive patients with Jefferson fracture during a 2-year period were reviewed. Each patient underwent a complete cervical radiograph series and a computed tomographic scan. The mean C1 lateral mass displacement was 1.8 mm. Cervical spine radiographs, including lateral flexion-extension views were obtained 10 to 12 weeks after injury before the removal of an external immobilization device. Of these 16 patients, 1 sustained a complete injury, and 7 sustained an incomplete injury. Eight patients were neurologically intact. Twelve patients sustained a stable Jefferson fracture and were treated with a rigid cervical collar (Miami-J collar [Jerome Medical, Moorestown, NJ]) alone from 10 to 12 weeks. The patient sustaining the complete neurologic injury died of multisystem trauma. All 15 live patients showed no instability on their follow-up plain radiographs before the removal of an external stabilization device. Six patients underwent further plain radiographs approximately 1 year after the fracture and similarly demonstrated no instability. Isolated stable burst fracture of the atlas can be treated effectively with a rigid cervical collar alone for 10 to 12 weeks with good neurologic recovery and segmental stability. Unstable Jefferson fractures with concurrent unstable fracture of other cervical vertebrae, especially C2, requires surgical stabilization.},

This lesion is associated with extension and axial loading injury, and there is a high incidence of injuries of the face or scalp and of associated fractures of the upper cervical spine. There is a low incidence of neurological injury, which seems paradoxical in the presence of what appears to be gross instability, but protection from extremes of flexion and extension may be adequate treatment. Union is usual regardless of displacement. Traction is a safe means of treatment, but early waking in a halo support reduces time in hospital without jeopardizing the result. Operation is needed only for chronic instability with or without pain, and anterior interbody fusion of C2--3 is than preferred in order to preserve rotation at the atlanto-axial joints.},

Associated neurological deficits were found in only four patients, although unassociated neurological deficits such as closed head injury were seen in eleven patients. Thirteen patients had other fractures of the cervical spine. Type-I fractures were stable injuries and were treated with collar protection. Most Type-II injuries were reduced with the patient in halo traction, and then immobilization in a halo vest was used. Type-IIa injuries, as they showed increased displacement in traction, were reduced with gentle extension and compression in a halo vest. Type-III injuries were grossly unstable and required surgical stabilization. All of the fractures healed, although the use of early halo-vest immobilization for displaced fractures resulted in significant residual deformity. The radiographic patterns of the fracture types and the resulting data on clinical stability suggested a correlation between the fracture type and the mechanism of injury. Type-I injuries resulted from a hyperextension-axial loading force; Type-II injuries, from an initial hyperextension-axial loading force followed by severe flexion; Type-IIa injuries, from flexion-distraction; and Type-III injuries, from flexion-compression.},

  abstract        = {Asymmetry of the interspaces between the odontoid process and the lateral masses of the atlas is a finding occasionally noted on anteroposterior open-mouth radiographs obtained following trauma. Controversy exists as to the clinical significance of this finding in minimally symptomatic patients. Some believe this asymmetry is a normal variant, while others suggest that pathological rotation of the atlas on the axis may be present. This condition has been termed atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation (ARS), and when not corrected by 15 degrees head rotation, is said to be "fixed." Recent experience has shown that some patients with radiographic findings of ARS do not exhibit clinical signs or symptoms, leading us to question the significance of the radiographic diagnosis. A study was performed to evaluate the incidence of atlantoaxial asymmetry in normal subjects, the effect of rotation on the atlantoaxial relationship, and the ability to correct asymmetry by rotation. Eleven normal volunteers were evaluated with the following anteroposterior open-mouth views: without tilt or rotation (neutral); 15 degrees rotation in each direction; 15 degrees head and neck tilt to the right; right rotation with right tilt; and left rotation with right tilt. Six normals (54%) demonstrated atlantoaxial asymmetry in the neutral position despite proper positioning. No predictable change in the atlantoaxial relationship was produced by any of the manipulations described. Two normal subjects fulfilled the radiographic criterion for fixed atlantoaxial subluxation (asymmetry not corrected by rotation). We conclude that the radiographic finding of atlantoaxial asymmetry is common and not in itself abnormal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The injuries were classified as disruptions of the substance of the ligament (Type I injuries, n = 16) or as fractures and avulsions involving the tubercle for insertion of the transverse ligament on the C1 lateral mass (Type II injuries, n = 23). These two types of injuries had distinctly different clinical characteristics that were useful for determining treatment. Type I injuries were incapable of healing satisfactorily without internal fixation; they should be treated with early surgery. Type II injuries, which rendered the transverse ligament physiologically incompetent even though the ligament substance was not torn, should be treated initially with a rigid cervical orthosis, because they had a 74% success rate nonoperatively. Surgery should be reserved for patients with Type II injuries that have nonunion with persistent instability after 3 to 4 months of immobilization. Type II injuries had a 26% rate of failure of immobilization; therefore, close monitoring is needed to detect patients who will require delayed operative intervention.},

  abstract        = {Hanging, a common method of execution, began in antiquity and continues to this date. Unfortunately, the exact cause of a victim's demise was not always obvious, and many victims died as the result of asphyxiation from the hangman's noose. In the latter part of the 19th century, scientific curiosity led to autopsy studies of the cervical spine; Paterson in 1890 first described the lethal lesion. Experimental work in 1913 demonstrated that when the hangman's knot was placed beneath the chin, death rapidly occurred because of a traumatic spondylolisthesis of the second cervical vertebra. This knot placement then became standard as the most efficient method of execution. It was not until the mid-20th century that the similarity between judicial and civilian injury was recognized. The reports were infrequent, and most of the pars interarticularis fractures resulted from automobile accidents in which the victim was thrown forward and struck his or her face against the windshield which caused sudden violent hyperextension. The similarity between civilian and vehicular injuries was recognized in 1965 by Schneider who, together with his associates, reported eight cases; it was this group who introduced the term "hangman's fracture". Garber presented his thoughts on this subject, noting that there was a difference between the forces generated by judicial hanging and those caused by motor vehicle accidents and other similar civilian injuries. The former results in axial loading and hyperextension, and, rarely, in flexion or axial loading. Since the lesion occurs at the pars interarticularis of C2, Garber suggested that a more appropriate term might be traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis.},

The results of treatment in these types were retrospectively analyzed. In all of nine cases of avulsion fracture and two cases of transverse fracture, bone union was obtained by nonoperative treatment. All three cases of burst fracture healed, one by nonoperative treatment, and the remaining two by C2/3 anterior interbody fusion. Bone union was also obtained in all of the 17 cases of sagittal fracture, which included nonoperative treatment in 15 cases, and transoral atlanto-axial fusion in the remaining two cases. because many axis body fractures are inherently stable injuries, the authors normally select nonoperative treatment as initial therapy. However, in sagittal fractures, eight patients had sequelae of nuchal pain caused by osteoarthrosis of the atlanto-axial joint. As a result of these findings, the authors deem it appropriate to utilize atlanto-axial fusion when severe malalignment of the atlanto-axial joint is recognized.},

Thirty-four patients with os odontoideum were reviewed in clinical symptoms and radiographs. The results were correlated to provide a rationale for the genesis of myelopathy. Instability of the atlantoaxial joint has been evaluated with atlantodental interval, space available for the spinal cord, instability index, and others. These are excellent indices for anteroposterior instability. However, they are insufficient for the evaluation of the multidirectional instability in os odontoideum. Thirty-four patients were analyzed in three parameters on the lateral radiographs: the minimum distance from the posterior border of the C2 body to the posterior arch of atlas, the difference of the atlanto-axial angle between the flexion and extension position (sagittal plane rotation angle), and the change of space available for the spinal cord from flexion to extension (Instability Index). The correlation between the sagittal plane rotation angle and the instability index was low (r = 0.561). In patients with more than 20 degrees of the sagittal plane rotation angle, myelopathy was shown at a high rate (86%). Myelopathy was also shown at a high rate (90%) in the patients with more than 40% of the instability index. It is important to check the sagittal plane rotation angle and the instability index to evaluate the instability in os odontoideum. If the patient has either a sagittal plane rotation angle of more than 20 degrees or an instability index of more than 40%, he or she is likely to have the cord signs.},

Nine of these patients had additional fractures in the first and second cervical vertebral complex, complicating the management of the fractures of the posterior arch. Two of the nine patients died, and the treatment of the other seven was dependent on the additional fractures. A second group of six patients had a fracture in the area of the lateral mass, with one fracture just anterior to or within the anterior portion of the lateral mass of the first cervical vertebra and a second fracture posterior to the lateral mass of the first cervical vertebra on the same side; resultant asymmetrical displacement of the lateral masses was seen on the open-mouth roentgenogram that was made for each patient. A third group of eleven patients sustained a Jefferson, or burst, fracture of the first cervical vertebra. These patients had either four fractures (two in the anterior arch and two in the posterior arch) or three fractures (one in the anterior arch and two in the posterior arch). Spreading of the lateral masses was relatively symmetrical on the open-mouth roentgenogram. Patients who had fractures with displacement of two to seven millimeters were treated with immobilization in a halo vest. Patients who had fractures with severe spreading of the lateral masses (more than seven millimeters) were treated with reduction of the lateral masses by axial traction until healing of the arch had occurred.

The mechanics of these fractures have mostly been described in the form of case reports. Here an attempt is made to classify fractures of the occipital condyle based on the literature and our own material. Fractures of the condyles in the sense of bursting or the injuries themselves are classified under the following forms of strain: 1. Axial compression (Jefferson type) condylar impression; 2. Axial traction (hangman's type) condylar retraction; 3. Rotation with axial strain condylar retraction; 4. Oblique compression (bursting fracture of the abutment) frontal condylar fracture; contralateral; 5. Oblique traction (horizontal thrust); a tearing at the base of the skull as in a contralateral condylar horizontal fracture; 6. Transverse thrust (longitudinal fracture of the base of the skull) partial condylar avulsion The functional connection between a longitudinal clivus and condylar fracture is illustrated by typical examples. Furthermore, the elliptical deformation model for a burst fracture at the base of the skull in the longitudinal axis is extended by the deeper transverse thrust stabilization of the condyles.},

  abstract        = {Occipital condyle fractures (OCFs) are infrequently recognized. Three recent cases of OCF in our center prompted a review of the incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of this entity. A retrospective review of medical records and radiographic results was performed for 93 of 316 consecutive patients who were victims of trauma, who presented at the Toronto Hospital during a 13-month period, and who had undergone computed tomography of the occiput. A review of the literature regarding OCF revealed that cranial nerve deficits occurred in 31% of the patients with OCFs; of those, the deficits were delayed in 38%. Three new cases of OCF, with neck pain but without cranial nerve deficits, have been reported. The cervical spine x-rays revealed nothing abnormal in 96% of the reported cases. In our retrospective review, asymptomatic OCF was revealed by computed tomography for 1 of the 93 patients. OCF is a diagnostic challenge. We suggest that computed tomographic scans of O-C2 be obtained in the following circumstances: presence of lower cranial nerve deficits, associated head injury or basal cranial fracture, or persistent severe neck pain despite normal radiographic results. We propose a new classification system for the management and treatment of OCF based on the stability of the O-C1-C2 joint complex reflected by the presence of displacement of the condyle, computed tomographic or radiographic evidence of O-C1-C2 instability, and magnetic resonance evidence of ligamentous injury. OCFs are divided into the following types: Type 1 (stable), undisplaced fracture; Type 2A (stable), displaced fracture with no ligamentous instability; and Type 2B (unstable), displaced fracture with ligamentous instability.},

This rather common occurrence, one of four, has not been emphasized in the recent literature, indicating that the radiologic examination should not stop after the craniovertebral fracture is identified. Furthermore, in 13 patients, neurologic deficits were encountered that in all instances were from associated lower-level fracture. From this experience it was believed that a minimum of anteroposterior and lateral views of the entire spine should be obtained in patients in whom a craniovertebral fracture is found, especially if neurologic deficits are present. The other sites of injury were in the lower cervical spine in 17 patients, in the thoracic spine in five, in the lumbar spine in two, and in the sacrococcygeal spine in two patients. Eight patients had three or more levels of fracture.},

To determine the optimal treatment of axis fractures based on 340 cases from a single institution. Axis fractures account for almost 20% of acute cervical spine fractures. However, their management and the clinical criteria predictive of nonoperative failure remain unclear. Admission imaging studies and clinical variables were obtained for 340 consecutive axis fracture patients. Fractures were classified as as odontoid Type I, II, or III with dena displacement on admission roentgenograms; hangman's fractures of Francis grade and Effendi type; and miscellaneous fractures. Treatment methods were documented, and outcomes were based on dynamic lateral roentgenograms, clinical examination, or telephone interviews at last follow-up. Follow-up data were available in 92% of cases. Type II odontoid fractures comprised 35% of all axis fractures, were the most difficult to treat, and had the highest nonunion rate (28.4%). Odontoid displacement of 6 mm or more was associated with Type II nonunion (chi-square = 33.74, P < 0.0001). Patients underwent surgical fusion if fracture alignment could not be maintained by an external orthosis, or if they had odontoid fractures with transverse ligament disruption, Type II odontoid fractures with dens displacement of at least 6 mm, or hangman's fractures of severe Francis grade or Effendi type. Type II odontoid fractures have the highest nonunion rate and were associated with dens displacement of 6 mm or greater. Early surgical fusion is recommended for acute fracture instability despite external immobilization, transverse ligament disruption, Type II odontoid fractures with dens displacement of at least 6 mm on admission, or severe Francis grade or Effendi-type hangman's fractures. Otherwise, nonoperative management is sufficient.},

  abstract        = {Recent advances and the technical options that have lately become available in the surgical treatment of spinal injuries mean that clear definition of the indications is essential. Precise observation and classification of each injury to the cervical spine are of paramount importance for this purpose, to allow the comparison of proposed methods of treatment and of the results obtained with them. There are a number of classification systems for injuries to the cervical spine, none of which, however, is generally accepted. These classification systems are based on different criteria, such as nature of the accident at which the injury was sustained, neurologic deficits, morphological criteria, the concept of instability, and implications for treatment and prognosis. These criteria, however, hardly allow the classification of most of the injuries affecting the upper and those affecting the lower cervical spine in a single system. Therefore, the authors propose a system of their own, which draws on the principles of classification suggested by the ASIF for fractures of the extremities. According to this proposed new system, injuries are divided into those of the upper and those of the lower cervical spine, and each of these two main groups is further divided into three subgroups. In the case of the lower cervical spine, injuries are classed according as whether they affect the anterior or the posterior section of the spine more, or both to the same degree. Beyond this, injuries are subdivided with reference to whether they affect primarily bone, bone and ligament equally, or primarily ligament. Further subdivision by severity and implications for treatment allows more detailed differentiation. This classification system is based on the analysis of over 200 cases of injury to the cervical spine treated by the authors and of cases from the literature.},

  abstract        = {Computed tomography (CT) has been demonstrated to be superior to radiography in identifying cervical vertebral injuries. However, many of these injuries may not be clinically significant, and require only minimal symptomatic and supportive treatment. It is therefore imperative that radiologists and spine surgeons have criteria for distinguishing between those injuries requiring surgical stabilization and those that do not. The authors propose a new classification of cervical vertebral injuries into two categories: major and minor. A data base, acquired on 1052 separate cervical injuries in 879 patients seen between 1983 and 1998, was reviewed. Four categories of injury based on mechanism [hyperflexion (four variants), hyperextension (two variants), rotary (two variants), and axial compression (five variants)] were identified. "Major" injuries are defined as having either radiographic or CT evidence of instability with or without associated localized or central neurologic findings, or have the potential to produce the latter. "Minor" injuries have no radiographic and/or CT evidence of instability, are not associated with neurologic findings, and have no potential to cause the latter. Cervical injury should be classified as "major" if the following radiographic and/or CT criteria are present: displacement of more than 2 mm in any plane, wide vertebral body in any plane, wide interspinous/interlaminar space, wide facet joints, disrupted posterior vertebral body line, wide disc space, vertebral burst, locked or perched facets (unilateral or bilateral), "hanged man" fracture of C2, dens fracture, and type III occipital condyle fracture. All other types of fractures may be considered "minor".},

  abstract        = {Injuries to the atlanto-occipital region, which range from complete atlanto-occipital or atlantoaxial dislocation to nondisplaced occipital condyle avulsion fractures, are usually of critical clinical importance. At initial cross-table lateral radiography, measurement of the basion-dens and basion-posterior axial line intervals and comparison with normal measurements may help detect injury. Computed tomography (CT) with sagittal and coronal reformatted images permits optimal detection and evaluation of fracture and luxation. CT findings that may suggest atlanto-occipital injury include joint incongruity, focal hematomas, vertebral artery injury, capsular swelling, and, rarely, fractures through cranial nerve canals. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the cervical spine with fat-suppressed gradient-echo T2-weighted or short-inversion-time inversion recovery sequences can demonstrate increased signal intensity in the atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital joints, craniocervical ligaments, prevertebral soft tissues, and spinal cord. Axial gradient-echo MR images may be particularly useful in assessing the integrity of the transverse atlantal ligament. All imaging studies should be conducted with special attention to bone integrity and the possibility of soft-tissue injury. Atlanto-occipital injuries are now recognized as potentially survivable, although commonly with substantial morbidity. Swift diagnosis by the trauma radiologist is crucial for ensuring prompt, effective treatment and preventing delayed neurologic deficits in patients who survive such injuries.},

The pertinent anatomy, mechanism of injury, clinical and radiologic evaluation and the management of these rare injuries are discussed in an attempt to alert physicians to this type of injury and to improve outcome. The data were obtained from a MEDLINE search of the English literature from 1966 to 1999 and the experience of 4 spine surgeons at a quaternary care acute spinal cord injury unit. Detailed anatomic and epidemiologically sound radiology studies were identified and analyzed. Only small retrospective studies or case series were available in the literature. Valid anatomic, biomechanical and radiologic evaluation was extracted from studies. Clinical data came from limited studies and expert opinion. Early diagnosis is essential and is facilitated by a detailed clinical examination and strict adherence to an imaging algorithm that includes CT and MRI scanning. When the dislocation is identified, timely gentle reduction and prompt stabilization throuigh nonoperative or operative means is found to optimize patient outcome. Atlanto-occipital dislocation should be suspected in any patient involved in a high speed motor vehicle or pedestrian collision. Once suspected, proper imaging and appropriate management of these once fatal injuries can improve survival and neurologic outcome.},

  abstract        = {Craniocervical dislocations are rare, potentially devastating injuries. A diagnosis of craniocervical dislocations may be delayed as a result of their low incidence and paucity of diagnostic criteria based on CT and MRI. Delay in diagnosis may contribute to neurological injury from secondary displacement resulting from instability. The purpose of this study was to define CT and MRI-based diagnostic criteria for craniocervical dislocations to facilitate early injury recognition and stabilization. Using CT and MRI, we (1) described the bony articular displacements characterize craniocervical injuries; (2) described the ligamentous injuries that characterize craniocervical injuries; and (3) determined whether neurologic injuries were associated with bony or ligamentous injury. Using a prospectively collected spinal cord injury database, we identified 18 patients with acute, traumatic occipitocervical injuries. We reviewed CT scans and MR images to document the height of the occipitoatlantal and atlantoaxial joints and integrity of craniocervical ligaments. Medical records were reviewed for neurological status. The primary measurements were number of patients with articular displacement, location of bony displacement, and number of patients with ligamentous injury. Thirteen of 18 patients had displacement outside the normal range. Six patients demonstrated displacement of both occipitoatlantal and atlantoaxial joints, whereas five patients presented with displacement through the atlantoaxial joints only. Two patients had an abnormal basion-dental interval only. Of 17 patients with MR images, the cruciate ligament was injured in 11 patients, indeterminate in four, and intact in two. All five patients with occipitoatlantal articular displacement had injury to the occipitoatlantal capsule. No patient had occipitoatlantal capsular injury without occipitoatlantal articular displacement. Three cases of complete spinal cord injury were found after occipitoatlantal-atlantoaxial dislocations. Three patients with occipitoatlantal-atlantoaxial dislocations were neurologically intact. The five patients with atlantoaxial dislocations and patients without displacement or ligamentous injury were neurologically intact. Five patients had cruciate ligament rupture or indeterminate injury but no joint diastasis. The occipitoatlantal joint capsules stabilize the occipitoatlantal joint; disruption of the occipitoatlantal capsule may suggest the presence of instability. Based on these findings, we identified two distinct injury patterns: isolated atlantoaxial injuries (Type I) and combined occipitoatlantal-atlantoaxial injuries (Type II). Occipitoatlantal joint capsule integrity differentiated these subsets and Type II injuries had a higher percentage of complete spinal cord injuries on presentation.},

  abstract        = {Blinded comparison of 5 methods to diagnose atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) on plain radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) of the cervical spine. To determine the best method to diagnose AOD. Several methods are proposed for the diagnosis of AOD, including the Power's ratio, X-line method, basion-dens interval, condylar gap, and Harris method. No blinded comparison of the results of these methods has been compared to patient outcome, and there is no information available regarding the accuracy of these methods applied to CT scans. Plain lateral radiographs and CTs of the cervical spine were reviewed in 104 patients, including 6 with AOD. Images underwent a blinded review by a board certified neurosurgeon (D.K.R.), orthopedist (P.A.A.), radiologist (J.C.), and emergency physician (D.B.B.). Each diagnostic method for AOD was applied for determination of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The ability to identify relevant anatomic landmarks was also tabulated. Average values for sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values for each method applied to plain radiographs are: 0.4625-1.0, 0.8933-0.9725, 0.2775-0.45, and 0.975-1.0, respectively. These values for each method applied to CT scans are: 0.7075-1.0, 0.8725-0.9775, 0.3175-1, and 0.98-1.0, respectively. Identification of relevant anatomic landmarks occurred 99.75% of the time when these methods were applied to CT scans compared to 39% to 84% of the time on plain radiographs. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of these methods improve when applied to CT scans because of better visualization of anatomic landmarks. This result suggests CT scans of the cervical spine may be warranted in all trauma patients suspected of having cervical spine injury.},

  abstract        = {Craniocervical dissociation (CCD) is a highly unstable and usually fatal injury resulting from osseoligamentous disruption between the occiput and C-2. The purpose of this study was to elucidate systematic factors associated with delays in diagnosing and treating this life-threatening condition and to introduce an injury-severity classification with therapeutic implications. In a retrospective evaluation of institutional databases, the authors reviewed medical records and original images obtained in 17 consecutive surviving patients with CCD treated between 1994 and 2002. Images and clinical results of treatment were evaluated, emphasizing the timing of diagnosis, clinical effect of delayed diagnosis, potential clinical or imaging warning signs, and response to treatment. Craniocervical dissociation was identified or suspected on the initial lateral cervical spine radiograph acquired in two patients (12%) and was diagnosed based on screening computerized tomography findings in two additional patients (12%). A retrospective review of initial lateral x-ray films showed an abnormal dens-basion interval in 16 patients (94%). The 2-day average delay in diagnosis was associated with profound neurological deterioration in five patients (29%). Neurological status declined in one patient after a fixation procedure was performed. There were no cases of craniocervical pseudarthrosis or hardware failure during a mean 26-month follow-up period. The mean American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score of 50 improved to 79, and the number of patients with useful motor function (ASIA Grade D or E) increased from seven (41%) preoperatively to 13 (76%) postoperatively. The diagnosis of CCD was frequently delayed, and the delay was associated with an increased likelihood of neurological deterioration. Early diagnosis and spinal stabilization protected against worsening spinal cord injury.},
